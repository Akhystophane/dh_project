    People pray to and weary the gods, now and then,
    About trifles unworthy to interest men;
    Thinking Providence cruel unless it contrives
    To design to their likings the whole of their lives.
    Why believe that Olympus should study us more
    Than it studied the Greeks and the Trojans of yore?

    A gaby was bit on the shoulder, one night,
    By a Flea, which took refuge instanter in flight.
    "O Hercules, Hercules, prithee come down,
    And exterminate Fleas!" cried the suppliant clown.
    "O Jupiter, strike with your lightning the beasts,
    And avenge me on them and their horrible feasts!"

    To punish a Flea, 'twould be rather a wonder
    If gods went to work with their clubs and their thunder.
