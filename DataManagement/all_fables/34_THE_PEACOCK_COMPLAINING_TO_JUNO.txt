    The Peacock to great Juno came:
    "Goddess," he said, "they justly blame
    The song you've given to your bird:
    All nature thinks it most absurd,
    The while the Nightingale, a paltry thing,
    Is the chief glory of the spring:
    Her note so sweet, and deep, and strong."
    "I do thee, jealous bird, no wrong,"
        Juno, in anger, cried:
        "Restrain thy foolish pride.
    Is it for you to envy other's song?--
    You who around your neck art wearing
    Of rainbow silks a hundred different dyes?--
    You, who can still display to mortal's eyes
        A plume that far outfaces
        A lapidary's jewel-cases?
    Is there a bird beneath the skies
    More fit to please and strike?
    No animal has every gift alike:
    We've given you each one his special dower;
    This one has beauty, and that other power.
    Falcons are swift; the Eagle's proud and bold;
    By Ravens sorrow is foretold;
    The Crow announces miseries to come;
    All are content if singing or if dumb.
    Cease, then, to murmur, lest, as punishment,
    The plumage from thy foolish back be rent."
