    A Man of cash and credit shorn
        (The Devil only in his purse),
    Resolved to hang himself one morn,
        Since death by hunger might be worse:

    A king of death which pleases not
        Those curious in their final taste.
    A rope and nail he quickly got,
        And fixed them to a wall in haste.

    The wall was weak and very old,
        With the man's weight it crumbling fell;
    When out there came a stream of gold,
        The Treasure that he loved so well.

    He did not stay to count, but ran;
        Pale Penury no more he feared.
    When in the miser came--poor man!
        To find his wealth had disappeared.

    "Gold gone! This cord's my only wealth!"
        He cried; "now I have lost all hope:"
    And so straightway he hanged himself.
        How changed the fortunes of that rope!

    The miser saves his wealth for those
        Who may be prudent, may be thieves;
    Into the grave perhaps it goes:
        Who knows the changes Fortune weaves?

    For Lady Fortune mocks outright
        At human nature's dying pangs;
    And if by you or me made tight
        The rope, she laughs that some one hangs!
