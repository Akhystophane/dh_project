    An Ass, with relics loaded, thought the crowd
    Knelt down to him, and straightway grew so proud;
    He took to his own merit, without qualms,
    Even the incense and loud chaunted psalms,
    Some one, to undeceive him, wisely said--
    "A foolish vanity has turned your head:
    They not to you, but to the idol pray;
    Where glory's due, there they the honour pay."

    When foolish magistrates rule o'er a town,
    It's not the man we bow to, but his gown.
