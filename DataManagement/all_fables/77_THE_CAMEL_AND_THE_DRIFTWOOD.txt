    The first who saw a real live Camel
    Ran for his life; the second ventured near;
    The third, with ready rope, without a fear,
    Made a strong halter the wild thing to trammel.
    Habit has power to quickly change
    Things that at first seem odd and strange;
    Stale they grow, and quickly tame,
    And hardly seem to be the same.
    And since the question's open, once there stood
    A look-out watching all the distant flood;
    And seeing something far off on the ocean,
    Could not conceal his notion
    It was a man-of-war; a moment past
    It turned a fire ship, all ataunt and brave,
    Then a big boat, and next a bale, and last
    Some mere drift timber jostling on the wave.

        How many things watched by the world agree
    In this--that far away you see
    That there is something, yet when sought,
    And seen still nearer, it proves nought.
