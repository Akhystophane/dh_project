    In a land where stags abounded,
        One fell very sick indeed;
    And he saw his bed surrounded
        By a dozen "friends in need."
    "Gentlemen!" he muttered, "leave me,
        Leave me, I implore, to fate:
    Since your tears can only grieve me,
        And your solace comes too late."
    Not a bit;--their lamentations
        Lasted for a week, or more;

    While they took their daily rations
        From his very scanty store.
    Bit by bit his food diminished,
        Under such attacks as these;
    Till the sufferer's course was finished
        By starvation--not disease.

    For comforters of every kind
    Some fee is necessary, mind;
    And nobody will give advice,
    Or shed a tear, without his price.
