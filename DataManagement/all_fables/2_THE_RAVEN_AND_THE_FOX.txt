    Master Raven, perched upon a tree,
    Held in his beak a savoury piece of cheese;
    Its pleasant odour, borne upon the breeze,
    Allured Sir Reynard, with his flattery.
    "Ha! Master Raven, 'morrow to you, sir;
    How black and glossy! now, upon my word,
    I never--beautiful! I do aver.
    If but your voice becomes your coat, no bird
    More fit to be the Ph≈ìnix of our wood--
    I hope, sir, I am understood?"
    The Raven, flattered by the praise,
    Opened his spacious beak, to show his ways
    Of singing: down the good cheese fell.
    Quick the Fox snapped it. "My dear sir, 'tis well,"
    He said. "Know that a flatterer lives
    On him to whom his praise he gives;
    And, my dear neighbour, an' you please,
    This lesson's worth a slice of cheese."--
    The Raven, vexed at his consenting,
    Flew off, too late in his repenting.
