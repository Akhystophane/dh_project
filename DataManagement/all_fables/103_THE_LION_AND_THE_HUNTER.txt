    A Braggart, lover of the chase,
    Losing a dog, of noble race,
    Fearing 'twas in a Lion's maw,
    Asked the first shepherd that he saw
    If he would kindly show him where
    The robber had his favourite lair;
    That he might teach him, at first sight,
    The difference between wrong and right.
    The shepherd said, "Near yonder peak
    You'll find the gentleman you seek.
    A sheep a month, that is the fee
    I pay for ease and liberty.
    I wander where I like, you see."
    And, while he spoke, the Lion ran
    And put to flight the bragging man.
    "O Jupiter!" he cried, "befriend,
    And some safe refuge quickly send!"

    The proof of courage, understand,
    Is shown when danger is at hand.
    Some, when the danger comes, 'tis known,
    Will very quickly change their tone.
