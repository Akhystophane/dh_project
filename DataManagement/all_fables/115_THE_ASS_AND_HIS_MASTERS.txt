    A Gardener's Donkey once complained to Fate
    Of having to rise earlier than the sun.
    "The cocks," he said, "are certainly not late;
    But I have got to rise ere they've begun.
    And all for what?--to carry herbs to sell:
    A pretty cause to break one's morning sleep!"
    Fate, touched by this appeal, determined well
    To give the beast to other hands to keep:
    The Gardener to a Tanner yields him next.
    The weight of hides, and their distressing fume,
    Soon shock our friend; he is far worse perplexed:
    His mind again begins to lower and gloom.
    "I much regret," he said, "my first good man,
    For when he turned his head I always got
    A bite of cabbage;--that was just my plan:
    It cost me not a single sous, or jot;
    But here no, no rewards but kick and cuff."--
    His fortune shifts; a Charcoal-dealer's stall
    Receives him. Still complaints, and <i>quantum suff.</i>
    "What! not content yet," Fate cries, "after all?
    This Ass is worse than half a hundred kings.
    Does he, forsooth, think he's the only one
    That's not content? Have I no other things
    To fill my mind but this poor simpleton?"
    And Fate was right. No man is satisfied:
    Our fortune never fits our wayward minds;
    The present seems the worst we've ever tried;
    We weary Heaven with outcries of all kinds.
    And yet, if Jupiter gave each his will,
    We should torment his ear with wishes still.
