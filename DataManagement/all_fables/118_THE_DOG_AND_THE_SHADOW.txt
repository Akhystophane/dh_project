    We all deceive ourselves, and so we fall;
    We all run after shadows, in our way:
    So many madmen, one can't count them all;
    Send them to Ã†sop's Dog,--I beg and pray.
    The Dog, who saw the shadow of the meat
    He carried, dark upon the liquid tide,
    Dropping his prey, snapped at the counterfeit:
    The river rose, and washed him from the side.
    True, with much danger, he regained the shore,
    But neither meat nor shadow saw he more.
