    An Eagle lodged its young within a hollow tree;
    A Sow lived at the foot; a Cat between the two.
    Friendly they were, good neighbours, the whole three,--
    Between the mothers there was no to-do.
    At last the Cat malignant mischief made;
    She climbed up to the Eagle: "Ma'am, our peace
    Is ended, death," she says, "is threatening; I'm dismayed.
    We perish if our children die; she'll never cease,
    That Sow accursed. See! how she grubs and digs,
    And mines and burrows, to uproot our oak;
    She hopes to ruin us and ours, to feed her pigs
    When the tree falls--Madam, it is no joke!
    Were there but hopes of saving one,
    I'd go and quietly mourn alone."
    Thus sowing fear broadcast, she went
    With a perfidious intent,
    To where the Sow sat dozily.
    "Good friend and neighbour," whispered she,
    "I warn you, if you venture forth,
    The Eagle pounces on your family;
    Don't go and spread the thing about,
    Or I shall fall a victim to her wrath."
    Having here also sown wild fears,
    And set her neighbours by the ears,
    The Cat into her hole withdrew;
    The Eagle after would not fly
    To bring home food; the poor Sow, too,
    Was still more fearful and more shy.
    Fools! not to see that one's first care
    Is for one's self to find good fare;
    Both stayed at home, still obstinate,
    To save their young from cruel fate.
    The royal bird, she feared the mine;
    The Sow, a pounce upon her swine;
    Hunger slew all the porcine brood,
    And then the eaglets of the wood;
    Not one was left--just think of that!
    What a relief to Madame Cat!

        A treacherous tongue sows misery
    By its pernicious subtlety;
    Of all the ills that from Pandora's box arose,
    Not one brought half so many woes
    As foul Deceit; daughter of Treachery.
