    A Lion, sickly, weak, and full of years,
        Desired a remedy against old age
    (<i>Impossible</i>'s a word no monarch hears
        Without directly flying in a rage).
    He sent for doctors--men of draughts and pills;
        From far and near, obedient to the call,
    Came makers-up of recipes and pills:
        The Fox alone declined to come at all.
    At court the Wolf malignantly referred
    To Reynard's absence, whereupon the King--
    Whose anger was aroused at what he heard---
        Decided on a rather cruel thing.
    He sent a force to smoke sly Reynard out,
        And bring him, willy nilly. When he came,
    The Fox could scarcely entertain a doubt
        As to whose tongue had put him thus to shame.
    "I greatly fear, your Majesty," said he,
        "You think me rude; you wrong me, if you do:
    For I was on a pilgrimage, you see,
        And went to offer up my vows for <i>you.</i>
    I scarcely need inform you I have met
        Expert physicians whilst I was away,
    And hope to cure you of your sickness yet,
        Which comes from coldness of the blood, they say
    You must, sire, skin a Wolf, and wrap the skin
        About you close, to get the body warmed;
    And when the heat has kindled up within
        The fires of life again, the cure's performed.
    Our friend, I'm sure, will take immense delight
        In lending you his coat; so, take it, sire."
    The Lion supped upon the Wolf that night,
        And made the skin a part of his attire.

    Courtiers, discretion is your safest plan:
        Malice is sure to find its source again;
    And, while you do yourself what good you can,
        Reflect that slandering others is in vain.
