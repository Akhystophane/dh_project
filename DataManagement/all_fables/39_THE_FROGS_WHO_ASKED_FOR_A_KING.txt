    Of Democrats the Frogs grew tired,
    And unto Monarchy aspired;
    Clamour so loud, that from a cloud
    Great Jove in pity dropped a King,
    Silent and peaceful, all allowed;
    And yet he fell with such a splash, the thing
    Quite terrified those poor marsh folks,
        Not fond of jokes,
    Foolish and timid, all from him hid;
        And each one brushes

    To hide in reeds, or sneak in rushes;
    And from their swampy holes, poor little souls!
    For a long time they dared not peep
    At the great giant, still asleep.
        And yet the monarch of the bog
        Was but a LOG,
    Whose solemn gravity inspired with awe
    The first who venturing saw:
    He hobbled somewhat near,
    With trembling and with fear;
    Then others followed, and another yet,
    Until a crowd there met;
    At last the daring mob grew bolder,
    And leaped upon the royal shoulder;
    Good man, he did not take it ill,
    But as before kept still.
    Soon Jupiter is deafened with the din--
    "Give us a king who'll move," they all begin.
    The monarch of the gods sends down a Crane,
    Who with a vengeance comes to reign.
        He gobbles and he munches,
        He sups and lunches;
    Till louder still the Frogs complain.
    "Why, see!" great Jupiter replied,
    "How foolishly you did decide.
    You'd better kept your first--the last is worst.
    You must allow, if you are fair,
    King Log was calm and <i>debonair</i>:
    With him, then, be ye now content,
    For fear a third, and worse, be sent."
