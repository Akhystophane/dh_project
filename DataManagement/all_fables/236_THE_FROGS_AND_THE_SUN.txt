    The daughters of the mud obtained
    Help from the star-king, while he reigned.
    Nor war, nor any like disaster,
    Could harm them under such a master.
    His empire was the most serene!
    The pond-queens (Frogs, I really mean:
    For why not give their honourable name?)
    Against their benefactors plotted; shame,
    Imprudence, pride, and base ingratitude,
    Good Fortunes children, roused the restless brood.
    They could not sleep a wink (to trust their cry):
    They would have stirred the world to mutiny
    Against the eye of nature--the great sun.
    It had begun to burn them: he must run
    To arms, and gather all his powerful band,
    Or he'd be driven from his own fair land.
    The croaking embassies would go
    Through all the regions, to and fro,
    To make the whole world hear their case,
    And gather pity from each place.
    All the world seemed bent on this,
    That four marshes took amiss.
    Still this rash complaint went on:
    Still this grumbling at the sun.
    Yet in vain the noise and riot,--
    Frogs must, after all, be quiet;
    For, if the sun is once inflamed,
    They will very soon be tamed,
    And the Frog Republic will
    Find they've calculated ill.
