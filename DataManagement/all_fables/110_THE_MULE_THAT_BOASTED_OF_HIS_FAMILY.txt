    An Episcopal Mule, of its family proud,
    Would <i>not</i> keep his ancestry under a cloud,
    But chattered, and bragged of his mother the mare:
    Of her having done this, and her having been there;
    And vowed that so famous a creature ignored,
    Was a shame and disgrace to historian's record.
    He frankly disdained on a doctor to wait,
    And patiently stand at a poor patient's gate.
    At last, growing old, in the mill he's confined,
    Then his father, the donkey, came into his mind.
    A misfortune is useful, if only to bring
    A fool to his senses--a very good thing--
    It's sent for a purpose, and always will be
    Useful to some one or something, you see.
