    A little Fish will larger grow, in time,
    If God will only grant him life; and yet
    To let him free out of the tangling net
    Is folly; and I mean it, though I rhyme:
    The catching him again is not so sure, <i>c'est tout.</i>
    A little Carp, who half a summer knew,
    Was taken by an angler's crafty hook.
    "All count," the man said; "this begins my feast:
    I'll put it in my basket." "Here, just look!"
    Exclaimed, in his own way, the tiny beast.
    "Now what on earth can you, sir, want with me?
    I'm not quite half a mouthful, as you see.
    Let me grow up, and catch me when I'm tall,
    Then some rich epicure will buy me dear;
    But now you'll want a hundred, that is plain,
        Aye, and as much again,
    To make a dish; and what dish, after all?
    Why, good for nothing." "Good for nothing, eh?"
    Replied the Angler. "Come, my little friend,
    Into the pan you go; so end.
    Your sermon pleases me, exceedingly.
        To-night we'll try
        How you will fry."

             The present, not the future, tense
    Is that preferred by men of sense.
    The one is sure that you have got:
    The other, verily, is not.
