    A young Mouse, small and innocent,
    Implored an Old Cat's clemency:--
    "Raminagrobis, let me live!
    Your royal mercy, monarch, give!
    A Mouse so little, sir, as I
    A tiny meal can well supply.
    How could I starve a family?
    Host, hostess, only look at me;
    I fatten on a grain of wheat:
    A mite my dinner makes complete.
    I'm thin, too, now;--just wait a bit,
    And for your children I'll be fit."
    Thus to the Cat the Mouse, aggrieved;
    The other answered. "You're deceived.
    Is it to me you talk like that?
    Go, tell the deaf and dumb--not me:
    Old Cats don't pardon, so you'll see.
    The law condemns, and you must die:
    Descend, and tell the Fates that I
    Have stopped your preaching, and be sure
    My children's meals will not be fewer."
    He kept his word; and to my fable
    I add a moral, as I'm able:
    Youth hopes to win all by address;
    But age is ever pitiless.
