    "What have I done, I should like to know,
    That my master should make me a public show?
    Amongst other dogs I can never now go!
        Oh, kings of animals, human race!
        Tyrants, authors of my disgrace!
    I wish some demon would treat you the same!"
    Thus a young Dog reflected, mad with pain,
    As they cropped his long ears, but his cries were in vain,
    And he thought himself lost; but he found, one fine day.
    That his loss was a gain, for, by nature endowed
    With a combative spirit, in many a fray
    He saw that to cropping his long ears he owed
    Avoidance of many a subject for tears,--
    Rough dogs, when they fight, bite their enemies' ears:
    For hostile mastiffs his were best of all.
    'Tis easy to defend one opening in a wall;
    Armed with a collar, and with ears but small,
    Our young Dog meets his foes, fights, and defeats them all.
