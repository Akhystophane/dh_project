    The King of Animals a <i>battue</i> made
        Upon his birthday, bent to fill his bags.
    The Lion's game is not with sparrows played;
    But boars of bulk, and good-sized portly stags.
        For an ally in this affair,
        He had an able minister.
    The Ass, with Stentor's voice, served as his hunting-horn;
    The Lion hid deep 'mid the thickest wood,
    And ordered him to bray loud as he could;
    So that the clamour shrilly borne,
    Might drive from every nook and lair
    Those not initiated to the sound.
    The hideous tempest came; the air
    Shook with the dreadful discord; round
    It flew, and scared the fiercest forest creatures;
    They fled with terror-stricken features.
    And fell into the ready snare,
    Where the King Lion stood to meet his prey.
    "Have I not served thee brave and true?"
    The Ass said, taking to himself the palm.
    "Yes," quoth the Lion, grave and calm,
    "'Twas nobly brayed;  I own to you,
    Had I not known your name and race,
    I had been almost frightened too!"
    Had he been rash, the Ass, his rage
    Would not have hidden, I'll engage.
    Just was the rallying, though severe;
    For who can bear a bragging Ass?
    It does not fit their rank or class,
    And very ill becomes their business here.
