    This Wolf recalls another to my mind--
    A friend who found Fate more unkind--
    Caught in a neater way, you'll see;
    He perished--here's the history:
    A peasant dwelt in a lone farm;
    The Wolf, his watch intent to keep,
    Saw in and out, not tearing harm,
    Slim calves and lambs, and old fat sheep,
    And regiment of turkeys strutting out;
    In fact, good fare was spread about.


    [Illustration: THE WOLF, THE MOTHER, AND THE CHILD.]


    The thief grew weary of vain wishes
             For dainty dishes;
    But just then heard an Infant cry,
    The mother chiding angrily--
             "Be quiet!
              No riot;
    Or to the Wolf I'll give you, brat!"
    The Wolf cried, "Now, I quite like that;"
    And thanked the gods for being good.
    The Mother, as a mother should,
    Soon calmed the Child. "Don't cry, my pet!
    If the Wolf comes, we'll kill him, there!"
    "What's this?" the thief was in a fret;
    "First this, then that, there's no truth anywhere;
             I'm not a fool, you know,
             And yet they treat me so.
    Some day, when nutting, it may hap
    I may surprise the little chap."
    As these reflections strike the beast,
    A mastiff stops the way, at one fierce bound,
    To any future feast,
    And rough men gird him round.
    "What brought you here?" cries many a one;
    He told the tale as I have done.
    "Good Heavens!" loud the Mother cried;
    "You eat my boy! what! darling here
    To stop your hunger? Hush! my dear."
    They killed the brute and stripped his hide;
    His right foot and his head in state
    Adorn the Picard noble's gate;
    And this was written underneath
    The shrivelled eyes and grinning teeth--
    "Good Master Wolves, believe not all
    That mothers say when children squall."
