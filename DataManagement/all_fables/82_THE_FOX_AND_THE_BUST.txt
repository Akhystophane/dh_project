    The great too often wear the actor's mask;
    The vulgar worshippers the show beguiles;
    The ass looks on the surface; 'tis the task
    Of the wise Fox to go far deeper; full of wiles,
    He pries on every side, and turns, and peeps,
    And watches--Reynard never sleeps.
    And when he finds in many a place
    The great man nothing but a pompous face,
    Repeats, what once he subtly said
    Unto a hero's plaster head---
    A hollow bust, and of enormous size--
    Praising it with contemptuous eyes,
    "Fine head," said he, "but without brains."
    The saving's worth the listener's pains;
    To many a noble lord the <i>mot</i> applies.
