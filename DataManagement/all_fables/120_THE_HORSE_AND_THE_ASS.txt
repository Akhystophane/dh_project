    In this world every one must help his brother.
    If your poor neighbour dies, his weary load
    On you, perhaps, may fall, and on no other.

    An Ass and Horse were travelling on the road:
    The last had but the harness on his back.
    The first, borne down unto the very ground,
    Besought the Horse to help him, or, alack!
    He'd never reach the town. In duty bound,
    Apologies he made for this request:
    "To you," he said, "the load will be mere sport."
    The Horse refused, and snorted at the jest.
    Just as he sneered, the Donkey died. In short,
    He soon perceived he had not acted right,
    And had his friend ill treated; for that night
    They made him drag the cart through thick and thin,
    And in the cart his injured comrade's skin.
