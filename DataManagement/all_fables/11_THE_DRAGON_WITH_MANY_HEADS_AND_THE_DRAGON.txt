    WITH MANY TAILS.


    An Envoy of the Grand Signor
    (I can't say more)
    One day, before the Emperor's court,
    Vaunted, as some historians report,
    That his royal master had a force
    Outnumbering all the foot and horse
    The Kaiser could bring to the war.
    Then spoke a choleric attendant:
    "<i>Our</i> Prince has more than <i>one</i> dependant
    That keeps an army at his own expense."
    The Pasha (man of sense),
    Replied: "By rumour I'm aware
    What troops the great electors spare,
    And that reminds me, I am glad,
    Of an adventure I once had,
        Strange, and yet true.
        I'll tell it you.

    Once through a hedge the hundred heads I saw
    Of a huge Hydra show.
    My blood, turned ice, refused to flow:
    And yet I felt that neither fang nor claw
    Could more than scare me--for no head came near.
    There was no room. I cast off fear.
    While musing on this sight,
    Another Dragon came to light.
    Only one head this time;
    But tails too many to count up in rhyme.
    The fit again came on,
    Worse than the one just gone.
    The head creeps first, then follows tail by tail;
    Nothing can stop their road, nor yet assail;
    One clears the way for all the minor powers:
    The first's <i>your</i> Emperor's host, the second <i>ours</i>."
