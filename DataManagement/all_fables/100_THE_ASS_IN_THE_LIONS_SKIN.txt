    A donkey donned a Lion's hide,
    And spread a panic, far and wide
    (Although the Donkey, as a rule,
    Is not a fighter, but a fool).
    By chance, a little bit of ear
    Stuck forth, and made the matter clear.
    Then Hodge, not relishing the trick,
    Paid off its author with a stick.
    While those who saw the Lion's skin,
    But little dreamed who lurked within,
    Stood open-mouthed, and all aghast,
    To see a Lion run so fast.

    This tale applies, unless I err,
    To many folks who make a stir;
    And owe three-fourths of their success
    To servants, carriages, and dress.
