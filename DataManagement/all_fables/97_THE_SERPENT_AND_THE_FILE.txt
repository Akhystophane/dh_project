    A Serpent once and Watchmaker were neighbours
    (Unpleasant neighbour for a working man);
    The Snake came creeping in among his labours,
    Seeking for food on the felonious plan;
    But all the broth he found was but a File,
    And that he gnawed in vain--the steel was tough.
    The tool said, with a calm contemptuous smile,
    "Poor and mistaken thing! that's <i>quantum suff.</i>
    You lose your time, you shallow sneak, you do,
    You'll never bite a farthing's worth off me,
    Though you break all your teeth: I tell you true,
    I fear alone Time's great voracity."

    This is for critics--all the baser herd.
    Who, restless, gnaw at everything they find.
    Bah! you waste time, you do, upon my word;
    Don't think your teeth can pierce the thinnest rind:
    To injure noble works you try, and try, but can't,
    To you they're diamond, steel, and adamant.
