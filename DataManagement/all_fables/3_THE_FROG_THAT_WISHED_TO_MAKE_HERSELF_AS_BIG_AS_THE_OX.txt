    A  Frog, no bigger than a pullet's egg,
    A fat Ox feeding in a meadow spied.
    The envious little creature blew and swelled;
    In vain to reach the big bull's bulk she tried.
    "Sister, now look! observe me close!" she cried.
    "Is this enough?"--"No!" "Tell me! now then see!"
    "No, no!" "Well, now I'm quite as big as he?"
    "You're scarcely bigger than you were at first!"
    One more tremendous puff--she grew so large--she burst.
    The whole world swarms with people not more wise:
    The tradesman's villa with the palace vies.
    Ambassadors your poorest Princelings send,
    And every Count has pages without end.
