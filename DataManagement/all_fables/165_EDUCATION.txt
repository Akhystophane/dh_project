    Cæsar and Laridon, his brother,
    Both suckled by the same dear mother,
    Sprang from an ancient royal race;
    Right hardy in the toiling chase.
    Two masters shared the noble brood;
    And one the kitchen, one the wood
    Made his home. Yet still the same,
    They both kept their former name.
    Place and custom altered them
    In their nature, not in limb.
    The one dog purchased by the cook,
    Laridon for title took.
    His brother to renown soon soars,
    Slays by dozens stags and boars.
    Soon as Cæsar he was known,
    And as wonderful was shown.
    But for Laridon none cared,
    Or his children--how they fared.
    So the Turnspits spread through France--
    Vulgar dogs, that toil or dance:
    Timid creatures, as one sees
    Cæsar's true antipodes.

    Time, neglect, and luckless fate
    Make a race degenerate;
    Wise men's sons turn simpletons;
    Cæsars become Laridons.
