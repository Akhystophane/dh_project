    Two steadfast Friends lived once in Monomtàpa;
    They loved as if really they'd had the same pàpa:
    What one earned the other earned. Ah! for that land;
    It's worth ten such countries as ours, understand.
    One night, when a deep sleep had fallen on all,
    And the sun had gone off in the dark, beyond call,
    One of these worthy men, woke by a nightmare,
    Ran to his friend, in a shiver, and quite bare.
    The other at once takes his purse and his sword,
    Accosts his companion, and says, "'Pon my word
    You seldom are up when all other men snore;
    You make better use of the night than to pore
    Over books; but come, tell me, you're ruined at play,
    Or you have quarrelled with some one; now, speak out, I say.
    Here's my sword and my purse; or, if eager to rest
    On a fond wife's compassionate, fondling breast,
    Take this slave: she is fair." "No, no," said the other,
    "'Twas neither of these things that startled me, brother.
    Thanks, thanks for your zeal; 'twas a dream that I had:
    I saw you appear to me, looking so sad;
    I feared you were ill, and ran to you to see:
    'Twas that dream, so detestable, brought me to thee."

    Which friend loved the most?--come, reader, speak out!
    The question is hard, and leaves matter for doubt.
    A true friend is choicest of treasures indeed;
    In the depths of your heart he will see what you need:
    He'll spare you the pain to disclose woes yourself,
    Indifferent to either his trouble or pelf:
    A dream, when he loves, or a trifle--mere air--
    Will strike him with terror, lest danger be there.
