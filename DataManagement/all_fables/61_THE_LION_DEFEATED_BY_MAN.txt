    A picture was exhibited, one day,
    In which an artisan had sought
    To paint a lion which had fought,
    And had been beaten in the fray.
    The passers-by were full of self-applause.
    A Lion who looked on reproached the crowd:
    "Yes, here I see," he said, "the victory is man's:
    The artisan had his own plans;
    But if my brothers painted, they'd be proud
    To show you man prostrate beneath our claws."
