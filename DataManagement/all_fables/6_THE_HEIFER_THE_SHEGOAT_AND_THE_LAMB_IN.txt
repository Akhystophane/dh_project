    PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LION.


    The Heifer, Lamb, and Nanny-goat were neighbours,
         With a huge Lion living close at hand,
    They shared the gains and losses of their labours
         (All this was long ago, you understand).
    One day a stag was taken as their sport;
         The Goat, who snared him, was of course enraptured,
    And sent for all the partners of her toil,
         In order to divide the treasure captured.
    They came. The Lion, counting on his claws,
         Quartered the prey, and thus addressed the trio--

    "The parts are four. I take the first, because
         I am your monarch, and my name is Leo:
    Being the strongest, I annex the second;
         As bravest, I can claim another share,
    Should any touch the fourth, or say I reckoned
         Unjustly, I shall kill him. So beware."
