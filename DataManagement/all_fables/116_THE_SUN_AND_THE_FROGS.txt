    A Monarch's wedding gave his people up,
    The whole day long, to dances and the cup;
    But Ã†sop found their doings in bad taste,
    And thought their joy decidedly misplaced.

    "The Sun," said he, "once thought about a wife,
    And fancied he could shine in married life;
    But instantly there came petitions loud
    From all the Frogs on earth--a noisy crowd.
    'Suppose,' they said, 'the Queen should be prolific,
    Our situation will become terrific.
    A single sun is quite enough to bear;
    The little ones will drive us to despair.
    Parched as we are, in sultry summer weather,
    The extra heat will roast us altogether.
    Let us entreat your mercy on our race;
    The river Styx is not a pleasant place!'"

    Considering that Frogs are very small,
    I think the argument not bad at all.
