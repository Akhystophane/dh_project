    One morning Doctor Much-the-Worse went out
    To see a patient, who was also tended
    By Doctor Much-the-Better. "Past a doubt,"
    The former said, "this case is nearly ended.
    There's not a chance."--The latter trusted still
    In physic's aid: but while the twin concocters
    Disputed hard on plaister, draught, and pill,
    The patient died from this attack of doctors.
    "Look there," said one, "I told you how 'twould be!"
    The other said, "No doubt you're vastly clever;
    But if our friend had only followed <i>me</i>,
    I know he would have been as well as ever."
