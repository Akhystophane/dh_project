    A savage Satyr and his brood
    Once took their lodgings and their food
    Within a cavern deep and drear,
    Which only very few came near.

    The Satyr, with his sons and wife,
    Led quite an unpretending life:
    Good appetite supplies the place
    Of luxuries in such a case.

    A Traveller, who passed that way,
    Entered the cave one rainy day;
    The Satyr proved a friend in need.
    By asking him to stop and feed.

    The other, as 'twas pouring still,
    Of course, accepted with a will:
    And warmed his fingers with his breath,
    For he was frozen half to death:

    Upon the soup then breathed a bit
    (The surest way of cooling it);
    Meanwhile, his host in wonder sat,
    And asked, "Pray, what's the good of that?"

    "Breath cools my soup," his guest replied,
    "And makes my fingers warm beside."
    The Satyr answered, with a sneer,
    "Then, we can do without you here.

    "Beneath my roof you shall not sleep;
    I scorn such company to keep.
    All people in contempt I hold,
    Who first blow hot, and then blow cold!"
