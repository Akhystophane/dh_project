    Once on a time, a little Carp to man
    Preached all in vain; they put him in the pan.
    And I repeat, 'tis foolish to let slip
    The glass that's full, and half way to the lip,
    In hopes of better wine. The fish was wrong;
    The fisherman was right, his reason strong.
    One speaks out boldly when a life's to save;
    It needs some eloquence King Death to waive;
    But still I hold I'm right, and don't demur,
    If from my former text I do not stir.
    A Wolf, less wise than our good fisherman,
    Meeting a Dog outside the village, ran
    To bear him off. The poor Dog pleaded hard
    That he was thin, and not worth his regard.
    "My lord, I shall not please you, that is pat;
    Wait till the marriage, I shall then grow fat
    And quite myself--when master's daughter's wed."
    The Wolf believed all that the terrier said.
    The day expired; he came with faith to see
    If good had come from this festivity.
    To Wolf without the Dog spoke through the gate:
    "Friend, I am coming, if you'll only wait;
    The porter of our lodge is coming, too,
    We'll soon be ready, sir, to wait on you."
    The porter was a mastiff, you must know,
    Ready to crunch up wolves, and at one blow.
    The caller paused: "Your servant I remain,"
    He said, and ran and sought the wood again;
    Swift, but not clever: the remark was made,
    "This Wolf was not a master of his trade."
