    Beside a fountain in the wood
        A royal Stag admiring stood:
        His antlers pleased him well.
    But one thing vexed him to the heart:
    His slender legs ill matched the part
        On which he loved to dwell.

    "Nature has shaped them ill," said he,
    Watching their shadows peevishly:
        "Here is a disproportion!
    My horns rise branching, tall, and proud;
    My legs disgrace them, 'tis allowed,
        And are but an abortion."

    Just then a deer-hound frightened him,
    And lent a wing to every limb.
    O'er bush and brake--he's off!
    At those adornments on his brow
    The foolish creature praised just now
    He soon begins to scoff.

    Upon his legs his life depends:
    They are his best and only friends.
    He unsays every word,
    And curses Heaven, that has sent
    A dangerous gift. We all repent
    Speeches that are absurd.

    We prize too much the beautiful,
    And useful things spurn (as a rule);
    Yet fast will beauty fleet.
    The Stag admired the antlers high,
    That brought him into jeopardy,
    And blamed his kindly feet.
