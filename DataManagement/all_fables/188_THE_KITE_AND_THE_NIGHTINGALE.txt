    A Daring thief, a Kite by name,
        Spread dire alarm o'er hill and dale.
    E'en little children cried, "For shame!"
        When he pounced on a Nightingale.

    The bird of Spring for life prayed well--
        "I'm fit for songs, and not for eating;
    Oh, hear my notes, and I will tell
        My tale of Tyreus, still repeating."

    "Tyreus! is that good food?" then said
        The Kite. "No, no;" was the reply;
    "He was a mighty king, who made
        His love to me, with vow and sigh.

    "His cruel love was strong: too strong!
        'Twas mad--'twas criminal: now, sire,
    Let me transport you with my song;
        A song so sweet you must admire."

    Not having eaten all the day,
        The Kite had other views of things.
    Thus--"What's the use of music, pray?
        I, too, can talk of mighty kings.

    "When you take kings--or kings take you--
        Sing to them and their pretty dears;
    I'm hungry, and know what to do--
        An empty stomach has no ears."
