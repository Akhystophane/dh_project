    The next example we must get
    From creatures even smaller yet.
    A Dove came to a brook to drink,
    When, leaning on the crumbling brink,
    An Ant fell in, and failed to reach,
    Through those vast ocean waves, the beach.
    The Dove, so full of charity is she,
    Threw down a blade of grass, a promontory,
    Unto the Ant, who so once more,
    Grateful and glad, escaped to shore.
        Just then passed by
    A scampish poacher, soft, bare-footed, came
        Creeping and sly;
    A crossbow in his hand he bore:
    Seeing the Dove, he thought the game
    Safe in the pot, and ready for the meal:
    Quick runs the Ant, and stings his heel;
    The angry rascal turns his head;
    The Dove, who sees the scoundrel stoop,
    Flies off, and with her flies his soup.
