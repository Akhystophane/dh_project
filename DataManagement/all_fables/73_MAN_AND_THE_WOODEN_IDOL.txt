    A certain Pagan had a god of wood--
    Deaf was the idol, yet had ears enough;
    The Pagan promised to himself much good.
    It cost as much as three men; for his fears
    Induced repeated vows and offerings;
    Fat oxen crowned with garlands and such things.
    Never an idol--think of that--
    Boasted of victims half as fat.
    Yet all this worship brought no grace,
    Treasure or legacy, or luck at play;
    What's more, if any single storm came near the place,
    This man was sure to have to pay;
    Yet all the time the god dined well. Now, was this fair?
    At last, impatient at the costly care,
    He takes a crowbar, and the Idol smashes
             (Crashes).
    Forth comes a stream of gold.
    "I feasted you with offerings manifold,
    And you were never worth an obolus to me;
    Now leave," he said, "my hospitality,
    Seek out another altar. I hold thee
    One of those gross and stupid creatures
    With wicked and untoward natures
    Whose gratitude can never grow;
    But after many a heavy blow,
    The more I gave the less I got; I own
    It's very well I changed my tone."
