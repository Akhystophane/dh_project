    A little Rabbit's charming nook
        A Weasel seized upon one morn;
    His household gods with him he took,
        Jane Rabbit's mansion to adorn.

    At break of day departed Jane,
        To munch amongst the thyme and roses,
    Returning, at her window-pane--
        "Why, there the wicked Weasel's nose is!"

    "Oh, gracious goodness! what is here?
        Turned out of my paternal hall!
    From this you quickly disappear,
        Or I'll give all the rats a call."

    The Weasel simply said the Earth
        Always belonged to the first comer;
    All other claims were little worth:
        A sufferance tenant a misnomer.

    A little kingdom he had found:
        "Now, tell me, what more right have you
    To these domains, this patch of ground,
        Than Tom or Dick, than Nan or Sue?"

    "Usage and custom of the law,"
        The Rabbit said, "give me the place:
    On sire's and grandsire's claims I stand--
        I, who here represent their race."

    "A law most wise! can't be more wise!"
        Said cunning Weasel. "What of that?
    Our claims to settle, I devise
        A reference to our friend the Cat."

    It was a Cat of solemn mien--
        A very hermit of a Cat:--
    A saint, upon whose face was seen
        Precept and practice, law, and--fat.

    The Rabbit here agreed, and then
        They sought the pious Pussy's home.
    "Approach--I'm deaf, he said; and when
        They came, they told him why they'd come.

    "Approach, fear not, for calm is law;
        For law no one here ever lacks;"
    And, stretching on each side a claw,
        He broke both litigants' weak backs.

    This story calls unto my mind
        The sad result which often springs
    From squabbles of a larger kind,
        Which small grand-dukes refer to kings.
