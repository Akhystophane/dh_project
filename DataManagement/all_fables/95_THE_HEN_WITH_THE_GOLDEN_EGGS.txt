    My little story will explain
    An olden maxim, which expresses
    How Avarice, in search of gain,
    May lose the hoard that it possesses.
    The fable tells us that a Hen
    Laid golden eggs, each egg a treasure;
    Its owner--stupidest of men--
    Was miserly beyond all measure.
    He thought a mine of wealth to find
    Within the Hen, and so he slew it:
    He found a bird of common kind--
    And lost a pretty fortune through it.

    For money-worms, who now and then
    Grow poor through trying to be wealthy,
    I tell my fable of the Hen;
    My tale is good, my moral healthy.
