    Few eyes are against beauty proof;
    Few hands from gold can keep aloof;
    Few people guard a treasure well,
    Or of strict faithfulness can tell.
    A certain Dog, true, brave, and stout,
    Carried his master's dinner out.
    This self-denial pressed him hard,
    When he had dainty food to guard:
    Yet long he kept it safe and sound.
    Well, we are tempted oft, 'tis found,
    By good things near us! Strange, we learn
    From dogs, and yet we hopeless turn
    From men when temperance is in view!
    One day this Dog, so staunch and true,
    A mastiff met, who wished to seize
    The dinner. Not so, if you please.
    The Dog put down the food, to fight
    A mighty combat. Left and right
    Came other dogs,--mere thieves and foes,
    Who cared not for the hardest blows.
    Our Dog, who dreaded every stranger,
    And saw the food was much in danger,
    Wanted his share. "Come, gentlemen,
    This rabbit does for me; now, then,
    You take the rest!" so he leaped on it,
    And then the others fell upon it.
    He snapped the best, and then they flew
    And shared the plunder,--the whole crew.
    So, sometimes, when they yield a town,
    And soldiers burghers trample down,
    Sheriffs and provosts are the worst
    To rob and pillage, being first:

    Pleasant to see them pistoles seize,
    Filling their purses at their ease!
    And if, by chance, to one more cool
    Some scruples come, they call him fool:
    Then he repents him of the blunder,
    And is the first to lead the plunder.
