    TO MADEMOISELLE SEVIGNE.


    Lady, whose charms were meant to be
    A model for the Graces three;
    Lend graciously your gentle ear,
    And but one simple fable hear;
    You'll see, without profound alarm,
    A Lion quelled by Cupid's arm.
    Love rules with such a tyranny,
    Happy those shunning slavery;
    Who the harsh monarch only know
    By song and poem, not by blow.


    [Illustration: THE LION IN LOVE.]


    When I dare speak of love to you,
    Pardon the fable, no whit true,
    That gives me courage to bring it,
    Perhaps with more of zeal than wit,
    A simple offering, rough and rude,
    Of my devoted gratitude.
        In times when animals could speak,
    The Lion came intent to seek
    Mankind's alliance--wherefore not?
    Since beasts had then by nature got
    Courage, intelligence, and skill;
    A bearing, too, by no means ill.
    Now hear what happened, if you will:
    A Lion of a noble race
    Saw in a vale a pretty face,
    A shepherdess's, understand,
    And instantly he claimed her hand.
    The father, prudent and pacific,
    Preferred a suitor less terrific:
    To give his daughter seemed too bad,
    Yet how refuse so wild a lad?
    If he refused, perhaps there'd be
    A marriage still clandestinely.
    The maiden liked her dashing wooer,
    Her boisterous, reckless, blustering suer,
    And playing with the creature's main,
    Combed it, and smoothed it o'er again;
    The prudent father, half afraid
    To spurn the lover of the maid,
    Said, "But my daughter's delicate,
    Your claws may hurt your little mate;
    And when you fondle and caress,
    Lion, you'll tear her and her dress;
    Permit me, sir, to clip each paw,
    It shall be done without a flaw,
    And, by-the-by, in the meanwhile,
    Your teeth 'twould be as well to file;
    Your kisses then would be less rough,
    And her's far sweeter--that's enough."
    The Lion, blinded by affection,
    Obeyed the artful man's direction;
    Toothless and clawless, he grew prouder
    (A fortress without guns or powder).
    They loosed the mastiff on him soon,
    And he was butchered before noon.
    O Love! O Love! when bound by you,
    Prudence, to thee we say, Adieu!
