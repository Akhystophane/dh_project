    The Eagle, queen of the broad sky,
    Met, one day, in a field, the Pie--
    In mind and language different,
    In plumage, and in every bent.
    Chance brought them into a by way:
    The Magpie was afraid to stay.
    The Eagle, having dined but lately,
    Assured her calmly and sedately.
    "Come, let's be social," said the Eagle, then;
    "And if the lord of gods and men
    Sometimes is weary of the king
    Who rules the universe, the thing
    Is clear, that ennui may e'en vex
    One who serves Jove. Amuse me!--come,
    And chatter as you do at home;
    It is not me you will perplex."
    The Pie began at once to gabble
    On this and that, on lords and rabble;
    Just like the man in Horace--just,
    Good, bad, indifferent, all on trust;
    Talking incessant, and still worse
    Than the poor fool in the famed verse.
    She offers, if it please his grace,
    To skip about, and watch each place
    He wishes. Jove knows that the Pie
    Was well constructed for a spy.
    The eagle answers, angrily,
    "Don't leave your home, my tattling friend.
    Adieu! I have no wish to send
    A gossip to corrupt my court,
    And spread each lying, false report:
    I hate a gossip." Quite content,
    Maggy cared little where she went.
    To dwell among the gods or kings
    Is not the pleasantest of things;
    That honour has its pangs also.
    Detractors, spies, and many a foe,
    Gracious and bland enough in face,
    But false in heart, infest each place,
    And make you odious. In courts wear
    Coats of two colours, or take care.
