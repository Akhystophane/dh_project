    The Grasshopper, so blithe and gay,
    Sang the summer time away.
    Pinched and poor the spendthrift grew,
    When the sour north-easter blew.
    In her larder not a scrap,
    Bread to taste, nor drink to lap.
    To the Ant, her neighbour, she
    Went to moan her penury,
    Praying for a loan of wheat,
    Just to make a loaf to eat,
    Till the sunshine came again.
    "All I say is fair and plain,
    I will pay you every grain,
    Principal and interest too,
    Before harvest, I tell you,
    On my honour--every pound,
    Ere a single sheaf is bound."
    The Ant's a very prudent friend,
    Never much disposed to lend;
    Virtues great and failings small,
    This her failing least of all.
    Quoth she, "How spent you the summer?"
    "Night and day, to each new comer
    I sang gaily, by your leave;
    Singing, singing, morn and eve."
    "You sang? I see it at a glance.
    Well, then, now's the time to dance."
