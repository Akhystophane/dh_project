    A Fowl, while scratching in the straw,
        Finding a pearl without a flaw,
        Gave it a lapidary of the day.
    "It's very fine, I must repeat;
    And yet a single grain of wheat
        Is very much more in my way."

    A poor uneducated lad
    A manuscript as heirloom had.
        He took it to a bookseller one day:
    "I know," said he, "it's very rare;
    But still, a guinea as my share
        Is very much more in my way."
