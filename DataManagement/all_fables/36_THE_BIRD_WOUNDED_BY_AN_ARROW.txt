    A  bird by well-aimed arrow shot,
    Dying, deplored its cruel lot;
    And cried, "It doubles every pain
    When from oneself the cause of ruin's ta'en.
    Oh, cruel men, from our own wings you drew
    The plume that winged the shaft that slew;
    But mock us not, you heartless race,
    You too will some time take our place;
    For half at least of Japhet's brothers
    Forge swords and knives to slay the others."
