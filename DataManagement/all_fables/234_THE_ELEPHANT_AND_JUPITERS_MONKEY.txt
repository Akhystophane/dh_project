    An Elephant had words, one day,
    With a Rhinoceros, they say.
    They settled they would fight it out.
    But, while the matter was about,
    Jove's Monkey, like a Mercury, came:
    Giles was, historians say, his name.
    The Elephant, a brute ambitious,
    Was pleased to find the heaven propitious.
    Eager for fame, he smiled to see
    So dignified an embassy.
    But Giles, though wise in all essentials,
    Is slow presenting his credentials.
    At length he comes to pay respect,
    Yet still shows somewhat of neglect;
    Speaks not a word: no single mention
    Of the great deities' attention.
    What care those living in the skies
    If perish Elephants or flies?
    The potentate's compelled to speak:
    "My cousin, Jupiter, this week
    Will see, from his Olympic throne,
    A pretty combat, as he'll own;
    And his Court, too, will see it partly."
    "What combat?" said the Monkey, tartly.
    "Pooh!" said the Elephant; "you know
    'Bout the Rhinoceros, and the blow;
    'Tis property that we dispute.
    In a long, tedious Chancery suit
    Elephantor and Rhinocere
    Are warring, as you've heard up there."
    "I'm pleased to learn their names, good sir,"
    Said Master Giles; "but, King, you err
    If you think we of such things heed."
    The Elephant, surprised indeed,
    Said, "Who, then, come you now to aid?"
    "I come to part a blade of grass
    Between some ants. To every class
    Our cares of sovereignty extend.
    As for your wars, my noble friend,
    The gods have not heard of them yet;
    Or, if they have, they do forget.
    The small and great are, in Jove's eye,
    Guarded with like equality."
