    A Certain hungry Fox, of Gascon breed
    (Or Norman--but the difference is small),
    Discovered, looking very ripe indeed,
        Some Grapes that hung upon an orchard-wall.
    Striving to clamber up and seize the prey,
        He found the fruit was not within his power;
    "Well, well," he muttered, as he walked away,
        "It's my conviction that those Grapes are sour."

        The Fox did wisely to accept his lot;
        'Twas better than complaining, was it not?
