    We ought to help each other, wise men say:
    An Ass forgot this motto, one fine day.
    I know not how our beast ignored the rule,
    For he's an amiable, good-natured fool.
    A trusty Dog so gravely paced along,
    The master took his nap at even-song:
    The Ass began to roam about and feed,
    And found, at last, a rank and savoury mead.
    There were no thistles,--that he must endure:
    One must not be too much an epicure.
    The feast was still not bad: while aught remains;
    'Twould pass for once, the air's fresh on these plains.
    The Dog, half dead with hunger, said, at last,
    "My dear companion, all this time I fast.
    Stoop down a bit, and let the panniers fall;
    I'll take my dinner out." No word at all
    The Ass vouchsafed, fearing to lose a bite;
    At length he deigned to answer the poor wight:
    "Friend, when your master rouses from his nap,
    He's sure at once to call you on his lap,
    And give you a good meal." A Wolf, just then,
    Ran forth, half famished, from his forest den.
    The Ass called loudly to the Dog to aid;
    The Dog stood still. "My friend," he quickly said,
    "Fly till your master wakes--he'll not be long;--
    Run fast. If caught, avert the coming wrong
    With a hard kick, and break the wretch's jaw:
    They've shod you lately, and you're right in law.
    Mind, stretch him flat." The Dog spoke wise and well.
    But the Wolf choked the Ass, and down he fell.

    Conclusion:--We should always help each other;
    And every man help carry his lame brother.
