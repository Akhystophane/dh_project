    The bird of Jove bore off a heavy "mutton;"
    A Raven, witness of the whole affair,
    Weaker in back, but scarcely less a glutton,
        Resolved to do the same, whate'er
             Might come of it.
             With greedy wit,
    Around the flock he made a sweep,
    Marking, among the fattest sheep,
        One of enormous size,
        Fit for a sacrifice.
    Said Master Raven, winking both his eyes,
    "Your nurse's name I cannot tell,
    But such fat flesh will suit me well:
    You're ready for my eating."
    Then on the sheep, slow, sluggish, bleating,
        The Raven settled down, not knowing
    The beast weighed more than a mere cream-cheese could.
        It had a fleece as thickly growing
    As beard of Polyphemus--tangled wood--
    That clung to either claw; the animal could not withdraw.
        The shepherd comes, and calling to his boy,
        Gives him the Raven for a toy.

    We must take care; the moral is quite clear--
    The footpad mustn't rob on the highway.
    Example is a dangerous lure, I fear:
    Men-eaters are not all great people; no, I say,
    Where wasps passed last week gnats are crushed to-day.
