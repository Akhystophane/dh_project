    There was a certain Ape in Paris:
    Like many another Ape, he marries.
    He chose a wife; and then, like some
    Bad husbands, beat her deaf and dumb--
    Aping their ways. The poor soul sighed,
    And, after that, at last she died.
    Their infant cries, but cries in vain,
    And sorrows, o'er and o'er again.
    The father laughs: his wife is dead,
    And he has other loves instead,
    Whom he will also beat, I trow;
    He's often drunk, that well I know.
    From one who's aping others look
    For nothing good; whether a book
    He makes, or work performs. Yes, all,
    Upon whichever one you fall,
    Are bad--the author ape the worst,
    And of all monkey creatures first.
