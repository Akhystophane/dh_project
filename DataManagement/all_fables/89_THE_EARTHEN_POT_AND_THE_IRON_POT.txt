    "Neighbour," said the Iron Pot,
        "Let us go abroad a little."
    "Thank you, I would rather not,"
    Was the answer that he got.
        Earthenware, you know, is brittle;
    And the weaker Pot was wiser
    Than to trust his bad adviser.

    "Mighty well for <i>you</i>" said he;
        "Skin like yours can hardly suffer
    Very much by land or sea,
    That is clear; but, as for <i>me</i>,
        Stop till I'm a little tougher.
    <i>You</i> may roam the wide world over;
    I shall stay at home in clover."

    "Friend!" the Iron Pot replied,
        "Don't let such a fear affect you;
    I shall travel at your side:
    So, whatever may betide,
        Cling to me, and I'll protect you."
    Having won his friend's compliance,
    Off they started in alliance.

    Jigging, jogging, on they went,
        Knocking one against the other;
    Till the Earthen Pot was sent
    (Past the powers of cement)
        Into atoms by his brother.
    'Twas his <i>own</i> imprudence, clearly,
    That was paid for very dearly.

    With our equals let us mate,
    Or dread the weaker vessel's fate.
