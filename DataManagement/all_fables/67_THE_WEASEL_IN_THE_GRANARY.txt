    Once Madame Weasel, slender-waisted, thin,
    Into a granary, by a narrow chink,
    Crept, sick and hungry; quick she glided in,
    To eat her fill, and she was wise, I think.
        There at her ease,
        No fear of fees,
    She gnawed, and nibbled:--gracious, what a life!
    The bacon melted in the strife.
        Plump and rotund she grew,
        As fat as two.
        A week was over,
        Spent in clover.
    But one day, when she'd done--and that not badly--
        A noise alarmed her sadly.
    She tried the hole she'd entered, wishing to retreat;
        'Twas no such easy feat.
    Was she mistaken?--no, the selfsame door:
        She tried it, o'er and o'er.
    "Yes, yes," she said, "it is the place, I know;
    I passed here but a week ago."
    A Rat who saw her puzzled, slily spoke--
    "Your pouch was emptier then, before your fast you broke.
    Empty you came, and empty you must quit:
    I tell you what I've told a dozen more.
    But don't perplex the matter, I implore;
    They differed from you in some ways, I do admit."
