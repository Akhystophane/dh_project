    Jupiter had a farm to give away;
    Mercury told the world the chosen day.
    The people came to offer, rough they were,
    And listened grimly. One said it was bare
    And stubborn land; another half agreed.
    While they thus haggled, churlishly indeed,
    One bolder than the rest--but wiser?--no--
    Consents to take it, if Jove only grant
    The climate that he wishes; he will plant,
    And sow, and reap, if but the heat and cold
    May come and go, like slaves, as they are told.
    The seasons wait his nod: the wet and dry
    Obey his bidding from a servile sky.
    Jove grants his wish--our foolish fellow sways
    His sceptre bravely--rains and blows for days;
    Makes his own climate just as he may please:
    His neighbours, no more than Antipodes,
    Share his good weather. Still as well they fare;
    Their barns are teeming full; but his art bare.
    The next year quite a change; another way
    He sets the seasons, watching day by day:
    Still, there's some flaw--his crops are thin and poor,
    While loaded waggons crowd his neighbour's door.
    What can he do?--he falls before Jove's throne,
    Confesses all his folly: he alone
    Has been to blame. Jove, with much gentleness,
    Like a mild master, pities his distress.
    It is agreed that Providence is kind,
    And knows far better than a human mind
    What's good for us, and calmly bids us do it:
    We seldom see our way till we are through it.
