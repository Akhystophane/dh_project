    Beside a well profoundly deep
    A Schoolboy laid him down to sleep.
    Ere care has racked with aches the head,
    The hardest bank 's a feather bed;
    A grown-up man, in such a case,
    Had leaped a furlong from the place.
    Happy for him, just then came by
    Fortune, and saw him heedless lie.
    She woke him softly, speaking mild:
    "I've saved your life, you see, my child.
    Another time you close your eyes,
    Be just a little bit more wise.
    If you had fallen down below,
    'Twould have been laid to me, I know,
    Though your own fault; and now, I pray,
    Before I take myself away,
    In honest truth you'll own the same,
    For I was hardly here to blame.
    It was not <i>my</i> caprice or joke."
    The goddess vanished as she spoke.

    And she was right; for never yet
    Have any a misfortune met,
    But Fortune's blamed: she has to pay
    For our misdoings every day.
    For all mad, foolish, ill-planned schemes
    We try to justify our dreams
    By rating her with curses strong.
    In one word, <i>Fortune's always wrong.</i>
