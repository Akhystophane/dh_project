    Two Thieves were fighting for a prize,
        A Donkey newly stolen; sell or not to sell--
    That was the question--bloody fists, black eyes:
        While they fought gallantly and well,
             A third thief happening to pass,
             Rode gaily off upon the ass.

    The ass is some poor province it may be;
        The thieves, that gracious potentate, or this,
    Austria, Turkey, or say Hungary;
    Instead of two, I vow I've set down three
    (The world has almost had enough of this),
        And often neither will the province win:
        For third thief stepping in,
             'Mid their debate and noisy fray,
             With the disputed donkey rides away.
