    None wish to cozen heaven but the fool;
    The mystic labyrinths of the human heart
    Lie open to the gods in every part:
    All that man does is under their wise rule,
    Even things done in darkness are revealed
    To those from whom no single act's concealed.
    A Pagan--a vile rogue in grain,
    Whose faith in gods, it's very plain,
    Was but to use them as a dictionary,
    For consultation wary--
    Went once to try Apollo to deceive,
    With or without his leave.
    "Is what I hold," he said, "alive or no?"
    He held a sparrow, you must know,
    Prepared to kill it or to let it fly;
    To give the god at once the lie.
    Apollo saw the plan within his head,
             And answered--
    "Dead or alive," he said, "produce your sparrow.
    Try no more tricks, for I can always foil;
    Such stratagems, you see, do but recoil.
    I see afar, and far I cast my arrow."
