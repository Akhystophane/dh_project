    In France there's many a man of small degree
        Fond of asserting his own mightiness:
    A "nobody" turns "somebody." We see
        In this the nation's natural flightiness.
    In Spain men are not vain; their high-flown schools
    Have made them proud, yet have not made them fools.

    A tiny Rat saw a huge Elephant
        Travelling slowly with his equipage;
    'Mongst beasts a sultan, knowing not a want.
        His suite comprised within a monstrous cage


    [Illustration: THE RAT AND THE ELEPHANT.]


    His household gods, his favourite dog and cat,
    His parroquet, his monkey, and all that.

    The Rat, astonished to see people stare
        At so much bulk and state, which took up all
    The space where he of right should have his share,
        Upon the citizens began to call:
    "Fools! know you not that smallest rats are equal
    To biggest elephants?" (Alas! the sequel.)

    "Is it his monstrous bulk you're staring at?
        It can but frighten little girls and boys;
    <i>Why, I can do the same.</i> You see, a Rat
        Is scarce less than an Elephant." A noise!
    The Cat sprang from her cage; and, with one pant,
    The Rat found he was not an Elephant.
