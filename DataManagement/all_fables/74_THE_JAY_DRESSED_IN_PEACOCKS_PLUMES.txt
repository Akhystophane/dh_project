    A Peacock having moulted, the sly Jay
    Put on the thrown-off plumage with delight;
    Amongst some other Peacocks found his way,
    And thought himself a fascinating sight.
    At last the would-be beau got recognised,
    A charlatan, in borrowed plumes equipt--
    And laughed at, scouted, hustled, and despised,
    Of all his second-hand attire got stript;
    Returning to his friends, abashed and poor,
    They most politely showed him to the door.
    Two-footed Jays are anything but rare,
    Who live on facts and fancies not their own;
    But these are, luckily, not my affair,
    So let me leave the plagiarists alone.
