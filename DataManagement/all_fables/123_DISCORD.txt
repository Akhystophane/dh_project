    Discord, who had the gods entangled
    About an apple--how they wrangled!--
    Was driven from the skies at last,
    And to that animal came fast
    That they call Man; her brother, too,
    "Whether or no," who long'd to view
    Our ball of earth. Her father came--
    Old "Thine and Mine"--the very same.
    She did much honour to our sphere
    By longing so much to be here;
    She cared not for the other race
    Who watch us from aerial space--
    We were gross folk, not tamed the least,
    Who married without law or priest--
    Discord no business had at all:
    The proper places where to call
    Scandal has orders to find out;
    She, a right busy, active scout,
    Falls quick to quarrel and debates,
    And always Peace anticipates:
    Blows up a spark into a blaze,
    Not to burn out for many days.
    Scandal, at length, complain'd she found
    No refuge certain above ground,
    And often lost her precious time:
    She must have shelter in this clime--
    A point from whence she could send forth
    Discord, west, east, or south, or north.
    There were no nunneries then, you see:
    That made it difficult, may be.
    The inn of Wedlock was assign'd
    At last, and suited Scandal's mind.
