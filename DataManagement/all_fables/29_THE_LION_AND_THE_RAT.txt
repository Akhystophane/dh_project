    It's well to please all people when you can;
        There's none so small but one his aid may need.
        Here are two fables, if you give good heed,
    Will prove the truth to any honest man.

    A Rat, in quite a foolish way,
        Crept from his hole between a Lion's paws;
    The king of animals showed on that day
        His royalty, and never snapped his jaws.
    The kindness was not unrepaid;
    Yet, who'd have thought a Lion would need aid


    [Illustration: THE LION AND THE RAT.]


        From a poor Rat?
        Soon after that
    The Lion in the forest brake,
    In their strong toils the hunters take;
        In vain his roars, his frenzy, and his rage.
    But Mr. Rat runs up; a mesh or two
    Nibbles, and lets the Lion through

        Patience and length of time may sever,
        What strength and empty wrath could never.
