    Two Mules were journeying--one charged with oats,
    The other with a tax's golden fruit.
    This last betrayed that manner which denotes
    Excessive vanity in man or brute.
    Proudly self-conscious of his precious load,
    He paced, and loud his harness-bells resounded;
    When suddenly upon their lonely road,
    Both Mules and masters were by thieves surrounded.
    The money-bearer soon was put to death:
    "Is this the end that crowns my high career?
    Yon drudge," he murmured with his latest breath,
    "Escapes unhurt, while I must perish here!"
    "My friend," his fellow-traveller made reply,
    "Wealth cannot always at the poor man scoff.
    If you had been content to do as I,
    You'd not at present be so badly off."
