    A Lion, once the terror of the plain
    (Borne clown with age, and weakened by decay)
    Against rebellious vassals fought in vain,
    And found his foes the victors of the fray.
    The Horse advanced, and gave his king a kick--
    The Wolf a bite--the Ox a brutal butt:
    Meanwhile the Lion, worn, and sad, and sick,
    Could scarce resent this, the "unkindest cut."

    But when an Ass came running to the place,
    The monarch murmured, with his latest breath,
    "Enough! I wished to die, but this disgrace
    Imparts a twofold bitterness to death."
