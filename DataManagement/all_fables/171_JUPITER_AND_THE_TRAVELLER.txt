    The gods our perils would make wealthy,
    If we our vows remembered, when once made.
    But, dangers passed, and we, all safe and healthy,
    Forget the promises on altars laid;
    We only think of what we owe to men.
    Jove, says the atheist, is a creditor
    Who never sends out bailiffs; if so, then
    What is the thunder meant as warning for?
    A Passenger, in tempest tossed and rolled,
    To Jupiter a hundred oxen offered.
    He hadn't one; had he been only bold,
    A hundred elephants he would have proffered:
    They'd cost him not a single farthing more.
    Suddenly mounted unto great Jove's nose
    The scent of beef bones burnt upon the shore.
    "Accept my promised vow," the rascal crows;
    "'Tis ox you smell: the smoke is all for thee:
    Now we are quits." Jove smiled a bitter smile;
    But, some days after, sent a dream, to be
    The recompense of that man's wicked guile.
    The dream informed him where a treasure lay:
    The man ran to it, like a moth to flame.
    Some robbers seized him. Having nought to pay,
    He promised them at once, if they but came
    Where he'd a hundred talents of good gold.
    The place, far off, pleased not the wary thieves;
    And one man said, "My comrade, I am told
    You mock us; and he dies, whoe'er deceives.
    Go and take Pluto, for an offering,
    Your hundred talents: they will please the king."
