    The Snake has two parts, it is said,
    Hostile to man--his tail and head;
    And both, as all of us must know,
    Are well known to the Fates below.
    Once on a time a feud arose
    For the precedence--almost blows.
    "I always walked before the Tail,"
    So said the Head, without avail.
    The Tail replied, "I travel o'er
    Furlongs and leagues--ay, score on score--
    Just as I please. Then, is it right
    I should be always in this plight?
    Jove! I am sister, and not slave:
    Equality is all I crave.
    Both of the selfsame blood, I claim
    Our treatment, then, should be the same.
    As well as her I poison bear,
    Powerful and prompt, for men to fear.
    And this is all I wish to ask;
    Command it--'tis a simple task:
    Let me but in my turn go first;
    For her 'twill be no whit the worst.
    I sure can guide, as well as she;
    No subject for complaint shall be."
    Heaven was cruel in consenting:
    Such favours lead but to repenting.
    Jove should be deaf to such wild prayers:
    He was not then; so first she fares;
    She, who in brightest day saw not,
    No more than shut up in a pot,
    Struck against rocks, and many a tree--
    'Gainst passers-by, continually;
    Until she led them both, you see,
    Straight into Styx. Unhappy all
    Those wretched states who, like her, fall.
