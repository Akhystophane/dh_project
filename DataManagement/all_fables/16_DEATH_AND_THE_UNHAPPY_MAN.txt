    A Miserable Man incessant prayed
        To Death for aid.
    "Oh, Death!" he cried. "I love thee as a friend!
    Come quickly, and my life's long sorrows end!"
    Death, wishing to oblige him, ran,
    Knocked at the door, entered, and eyed the man.
    "What do I see? begone, thou hideous thing!
        The very sight
    Strikes me with horror and affright!
    Begone, old Death!--Away, thou grisly King!"
    Mec√¶nas (hearty fellow) somewhere said;
        "Let me be gouty, crippled, impotent and lame,
        'Tis all the same.
    So I but keep on living. Death, thou slave!
    Come not at all, and I shall be content."
    And that was what the man I mention meant.
